ALGORITHM FOR RETRIEVING OYO EMPLOYEE DETAILS:
1. Connect to the MySQL database
2. Use the correct database (e.g., USE oyo_db;)
3. Define the columns to be retrieved from the employee table
4. Construct the SQL query using the SELECT statement
   4.1. Specify the columns to retrieve (e.g., first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, department)
   4.2. Include the FROM clause with the table name (e.g., FROM employees)
   4.3. Add any necessary filters or conditions using the WHERE clause (e.g., department = 'Operations')
   4.4. Include any sorting or ordering using the ORDER BY clause (e.g., ORDER BY hire_date DESC)
5. Execute the SQL query
6. Process and display the retrieved OYO employee details

EXAMPLE CODE:
USE oyo_db;
SELECT first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, department
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Operations'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
